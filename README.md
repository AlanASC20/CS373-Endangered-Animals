# Endangered Animals

This repository is the front-end interface for the Software Engineering Group #22. We build off of a React-Boostrap framework in order to combine different data sets into one, meaningful website. In our case specifically, we've compiled information and rich multimedia sources to show concise information on endangered animals and the environments they exist in.
