## <span class="fa-title">Self Critique</span>

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What we did well on</span>

- We have the website
- Clean and simple layout
- Fully functional and get things done

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What we learned</span>
- Teamwork
- Start early
- Nothing is impossible

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What we could do better on</span>
- Add more animals to the website
<br>Limitation: slow loading speed, could be improved
- Could not show full datas
<br>Limitation: long pages
- Made a better user layout, font, color schemes, images

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What puzzled us</span>
- Flask, Bootstrap, React
- Google cloud deployment
<br>
<span class="fa-pyline">From simple compile errors to 502 Bad Gateway errors</span>
<br>
-> Change from App Engine to manually create Docker image and managing it with Kubernetes and Container Engine

## <span class="fa-purple">What they did well on</span>

<span class="fa-pyline">
- Neat and simple layout; color scheme matches the game's color  (black/orange color)
- Images are well organized; clear presentation of heroes
- Site loads fast and is responsive
</span>

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What we learned from them</span>

- In the future, we should focus more on the following: 
  *<span class="fa-pyline">font</span>
  *<span class="fa-pyline">color schemes</span>
  *<span class="fa-pyline">general theme</span>
- Current: <span class="fa-pyline">lots of text </span>
<br> -> Re-design layout: <span class="fa-pyline">re-arrange text, images</span>
- Improve the loading speed

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What they can do better</span>
- REST-API: Lack of error handling
### Ex: Need to provide better error messages than an empty list, or 
### Need to catch common error inputs, such as a bad input type, blank input type, value not in database, etc.
- Apiary: Need to provide sample responses for each endpoint. Currently, there are none.
- Top players should have a filter to sort the players by rank/level/win rate


---
- List of choices when click on filter button should be scrollable.
- "Hero association" in Achievements should show a list of heroes.

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What puzzled us about their website</span>
- Top players are not "ranked" by any criteria, just list of names.
- Some of the links to images in the "Items" model are broken.
