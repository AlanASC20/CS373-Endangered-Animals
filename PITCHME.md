#### <span class="fa-byline">What they do well</span>

- 

---

What do we learn from them

---

What they can do better

---

What puzzles us about their website

---

- should show "not found" if there is no result for the search

- Consistency:
- front page "overwatch image" isn't stretched full screen like others, better to remove

- Ambiguity of top players
http://overwatchglamour.me/players

What is the ranking system? By score? By rank? By level ? By win/rate
Should put a filter/sort for those. noone interested in "name"

- Search seems to find the text in the data, not for the title. It's counter intuitive since reader only read the title.. So as the highlight
