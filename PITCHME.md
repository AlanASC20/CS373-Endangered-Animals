## <span class="fa-purple">What they do well</span>

<span class="fa-pyline">
- Neat and simple layout, themes are fit with the game (black/orange color)
- Images are well organized, clear presentation of heroes
- The site loads fast and responsive, no broken links or user errors (spellings, ect)
</span>

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What we learn from them</span>

- Spend more time on the layout: <span class="fa-pyline">font, color schemes, general theme</span>
- Current: <span class="fa-pyline">lots of text </span>
-> Re-design layout: <span class="fa-pyline">re-arrange text, images</span>
- Improve the loading speed

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What they can do better</span>
<span class="fa-pyline"> REST-API </span>
	- Lack or error handling
	Ex: typing string to get hero's ID yeild 404 error rather than returning an empty list
	- Should provide sample response for a sample input. Currently only return "200" OK reponse

What puzzles us about their website

---

- should show "not found" if there is no result for the search

- Consistency:
- front page "overwatch image" isn't stretched full screen like others, better to remove

- Ambiguity of top players
http://overwatchglamour.me/players

What is the ranking system? By score? By rank? By level ? By win/rate
Should put a filter/sort for those. noone interested in "name"

- Search seems to find the text in the data, not for the title. It's counter intuitive since reader only read the title.. So as the highlight
