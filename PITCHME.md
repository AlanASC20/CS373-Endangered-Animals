## <span class="fa-title">Self Critique</span>

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What we did well on</span>

- We were able to complete the website, given our limited time and resources.
- Clean and simple layout
- APIs and code are relatively scalable.

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What we learned</span>
- Teamwork
- Start early
- Nothing is impossible

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What we could do better on</span>
- Add more animals to the website (currently, only have 100).
- Improve loading time of pages
- Show more data
- Create a better user layout, font, color schemes, images

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What puzzled us</span>
- Flask, Bootstrap, React
- Google cloud deployment
<br>
<span class="fa-pyline">From simple compile errors to 502 Bad Gateway errors</span>
<br>
-> Change from App Engine to manually create Docker image and managing it with Kubernetes and Container Engine

## <span class="fa-purple">What they did well on</span>

<span class="fa-pyline">
- Neat and simple layout; color scheme matches the game's color  (black/orange color)
- Images are well organized; clear presentation of heroes
- Site loads fast and is responsive
</span>

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What we learned from them</span>

- In the future, we should focus more on the following: 
  * <span class="fa-pyline">font</span>
  * <span class="fa-pyline">color schemes</span>
  * <span class="fa-pyline">general theme</span>
- Current: <span class="fa-pyline">lots of text </span>
<br> -> Re-design layout: <span class="fa-pyline">re-arrange text, images</span>
- Improve the overall loading speed

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What they can do better</span>
- REST-API: Lack of error handling
  * Ex: Need to provide better error messages than an empty list or a "502 Bad Gateway Error"
  * Need to catch common error inputs, such as:
    - bad input type
    - blank input type  
    - value not in database, etc.
- Apiary: Need to provide sample responses for each endpoint. Currently, there are none.



---
- Top players should have a filter to sort the players by rank/level/win rate
- When a filter button is clicked, the list of choices should be scrollable.
- "Hero association" in Achievements should show a list of heroes.

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What puzzled us about their website</span>
- What makes a player a "Top Player"?
  * Currently, top players are not "ranked" by any criteria, just list of names.
  * Is a top player the one who has the highest...:
    * rank?
    * level?
    * win rate?
- Some of the links to images in the "Items" model are broken.
