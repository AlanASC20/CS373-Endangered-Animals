## <span class="fa-title">Self Critique</span>

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What we did well</span>

- We have the website
- Clean and simple layout
- Fully functional and get things done

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What we learnt</span>
- Teamwork
- Start early
- Nothing is impossible

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What we could do better</span>
- Add more animals to the website
<br>Limitation: slow loading speed, could be improved
- Could not show full datas
<br>Limitation: long pages
- Made a better user layout, font, color schemes, images

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What puzzles us</span>
- Flask, Bootstrap, React
- Google cloud deployment
<br>
<span class="fa-pyline">From simple compile errors to 502 Bad Gateway errors</span>
<br>
-> Change from App Engine to manually create Docker image and managing it with Kubernetes and Container Engine

## <span class="fa-purple">What they do well</span>

<span class="fa-pyline">
- Neat and simple layout, themes are fit with the game (black/orange color)
- Images are well organized, clear presentation of heroes
- The site loads fast and responsive, no broken links or user errors (spellings, ect)
</span>

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What we learn from them</span>

- Spend more time on the layout: 
<br> <span class="fa-pyline">font, color schemes, general theme</span>
- Current: <span class="fa-pyline">lots of text </span>
<br> -> Re-design layout: <span class="fa-pyline">re-arrange text, images</span>
- Improve the loading speed

---

## <span class="fa-purple">What they can do better</span>
- REST-API: Lack or error handling
<br>
Ex: typing string to get hero's ID yeild 404 error rather than returning an empty list
- Should provide sample response for a sample input. Currently only return "200" OK reponse
- Top players should have a filter to sort the players by rank/level/win rate


---
- List of choices when click on filter button should be scrollable.
- "Hero association" in Achievements should show a list of heroes.

---
## <span class="fa-purple">What puzzles us about their website</span>
- Top players are not "ranked" by any criteria, just list of names.
